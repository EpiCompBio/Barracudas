Dimensionality reduction through Principal Components Analysis 

### Auto-encoders 

Dimensionality reduction through Neural Networks

# Methods for clustering : 

### Kmeans

### Partitioning around medoids

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids

### Spectral Clustering 

Changing the space so it becomes easier to makes clusters with stuff like kmeans

### DBSCAN

Density based clustering

https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf

### Affinity Propagation 

### Gaussian Mixture Models 

Model based clustering 

https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval/home/week/4

### Unsupervised Random Forests 

Compute a proximity matrix through random forests and then use a standard algorithm such as PAM

# Methods to analyse clustering results  : 

### Silhouette : 

Mean proximity to points in cluster vs closest point of other cluster

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)
