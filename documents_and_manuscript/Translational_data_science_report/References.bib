	abstract="A Monte Carlo evaluation of thirty internal criterion measures 
	for cluster analysis was conducted. Artificial data sets were constructed 
	with clusters which exhibited the properties of internal cohesion and 
	external isolation. The data sets were analyzed by four hierarchical 
	clustering methods. The resulting values of the internal criteria were 
	compared with two external criterion indices which determined the degree of 
	recovery of correct cluster structure by the algorithms. The results 
	indicated that a subset of internal criterion measures could be identified 
	which appear to be valid indices of correct cluster recovery. Indices from 
	this subset could form the basis of a permutation test for the existence of 
	cluster structure or a clustering algorithm.",
